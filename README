This is a data base that uses the structure of a linked list. It utilizes 
multiple classes and calls functions within those classes using a driver
file. This is written in object-oriented design. The Client class acts as
the value to be inserted into the database. A client has a name, ID number,
and a birthday. All of these fields stay parallel to the corresponding
main client defined by the constructor. Inputs to the database and its
occupancy are saved to the hard disk using file management functions found in 
the FileManager class. Client is a friend of FileManager so Clients' datafields
can be printed. The datafile is the actual representation of the database
keeping track of inputs and organizing them in format. The format style of the
ASCII character generated database are part of the functionalities in the
FileManager class. This database also has a debug mode, the '-X' option
which is parsed from the commandline parameters. Every function checks to see
if debugging is on through setter functions that turn on or off a boolean
flag based on the commandline arguments detected by the driver. Within
each function, if debugging is on, it will display static messages to stderr
as the program is running. Leaving this feature off simply makes these messages
absent on output.
